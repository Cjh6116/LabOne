The X-axis will be the dates in years and, on the Y-axis, will be the average snowfall in inches. "

        "After taking the average snowfall throughout a three-year period I have noticed that the data shows about a constant trend. The snowfall increased a miniscule amount in 2018 and declined to an average of one inch in 2019, fluctuating 0.07 of an inch. Looking back, this wasn't the best depiction seeing as it only covers a three-year period."
